  Scenario: Create a Short answer question
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as teacher
    And I add a "Short answer" question filling the form with:
      | Question name        | shortanswer-001                           |
      | Question text        | What is the national langauge in France?  |
      | General feedback     | The national langauge in France is French |
      | Default mark         | 1                                         |
      | Case sensitivity     | No, case is unimportant                   |
      | id_answer_0          | French                                    |
      | id_fraction_0        | 100%                                      |
      | id_feedback_0        | Well done. French is correct.             |
      | id_answer_1          | *                                         |
      | id_fraction_1        | None                                      |
      | id_feedback_1        | Your answer is incorrect.                 |
    Then I should see "shortanswer-001"
